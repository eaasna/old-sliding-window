# Sliding window filter
### A fast and space-efficient pre-filter for querying very large collections of nucleotide sequences
The aim of this repository is to develop an IBF based prefilter for metagenomics read mapping. The IBF is created from the (k,k)-minimiser content of the reference database. The filter excludes parts of the reference datbase for each query read. Only reference sequences where an approximate local match for the query sequence was found are retained. 
A local match is defined as:
* length >= w
* errors <= e

where w is the window length and e is the allowed number of errors. Each read is divided into multiple possibly overlapping windows. The (k, k)-minimiser content of each window is then queried in the IBF.

## Download and Installation
There may be performance benefits when compiling from source, especially when using `-march=native` as compiler directive.

### Compile from source
<details><summary>Prerequisites</summary>

```bash

cmake ..
make
```

The binary can be found in `bin`.

You may want to add the raptor executable yo your PATH:
```
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH
raptor --version
```

</details>

## Example Data and Usage
A toy data set can be found [here](https://ftp.imp.fu-berlin.de/pub/seiler/raptor/).

```bash
wget https://ftp.imp.fu-berlin.de/pub/seiler/raptor/example_data.tar.gz
tar xfz example_data.tar.gz
```

After extraction, the `example_data` will look like:

```console
$ tree -L 2 example_data
example_data
├── 1024
│   ├── bins
│   └── reads
└── 64
    ├── bins
    └── reads
```

The `bins` folder contains a FASTA file for each bin and the `reads` directory contains a FASTQ file for each bin containing reads from the respective bin (with 2 errors).
Additionally, `mini.fastq` (5 reads of all bins), `all.fastq` (concatenation of all FASTQ files) and `all10.fastq` (`all.fastq` repeated 10 times) are provided in the `reads` folder.

In the following, we will use the `64` data set.
We can now build an index over all the bins:

```
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --output index.raptor $(seq -f "example_data/64/bins/bin_%02g.fasta" 0 1 63)
# You can replace `$(seq -f "example_data/64/bins/bin_%02g.fasta" 0 1 63)` by `example_data/64/bins/bin_{00..63}.fasta` if your shell supports this syntax.
# The equivalent command for 1,024 bins is `$(seq -f "example_data/1024/bins/bin_%04g.fasta" 0 1 1023)`
```

You can also prepare a file that contains one file path per line (a line corresponds to a bin) and use this file as input:
```
seq -f "example_data/64/bins/bin_%02g.fasta" 0 1 63 > all_bin_paths.txt
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --output another_index.raptor all_bin_paths.txt
```

You may be prompted to enable or disable automatic update notifications. For questions, please consult [the SeqAn documentation](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/wiki/Update-Notifications).

Afterwards, we can search for all reads from bin 1:

```
raptor search --kmer 19 --window 23 --error 2 --index index.raptor --query example_data/64/reads/mini.fastq --output search.output
```

Each line of the output consists of the read ID (in the toy example these are numbers) and the corresponding bins in which they were found:
```text
0       0,
1       0,
2       0,
3       0,
4       0,
16384   1,
...
1015812 62,
1032192 63,
1032193 63,
1032194 63,
1032195 63,
1032196 63,
```

For a list of options, see the help pages:
```console
raptor --help
raptor build --help
raptor search --help
```

### Preprocessing the input
We offer the option to precompute the minimisers of the input files. This is useful to build indices of big datasets (in the range of several TiB) and also allows an estimation of the needed index size since the amount of minimisers is known.
Following above example, we would change the build step as follows:

First we precompute the minimisers and store them in a directory:
```
mkdir -p precomputed_minimisers
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --compute-minimiser --output precomputed_minimisers/ $(seq -f "example_data/64/bins/bin_%02g.fasta" 0 1 63)
```

Then we run the build step again and use the computed minimisers as input:
```
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --output minimiser_index.raptor $(seq -f "precomputed_minimisers/bin_%02g.minimiser" 0 1 63)
```

Alternatively, you can also prepare a file that contains one file path per line (a line corresponds to a bin)
and use this file as input for both cases:
```
seq -f "example_data/64/bins/bin_%02g.fasta" 0 1 63 > all_bin_paths.txt
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --compute-minimiser --output precomputed_minimisers/ all_bin_paths.txt
seq -f "precomputed_minimisers/bin_%02g.minimiser" 0 1 63 > all_minimiser_paths.txt
raptor build --kmer 19 --window 23 --size 8m --output another_minimiser_index.raptor all_minimiser_paths.txt
```
